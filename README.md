# Galactic Frontier

Uploaded the windows build here. To play the game on browser, [Galatic Frontier](https://djkoholic.itch.io/galactic-frontier)

Modifications:

- Created two unique levels
- Added a whole new theme to level 2 where its all dark and visibility is minimal
- Created two new powerups (level 2), one increases your movement abilities and other increases the visibility (refer instructions in game)
- Both powerups are timed powerups and movement one respawns after wearing off
- Created chat bubble prototype as in the example. Its not very good visually and did not use to too much due to deadline
- Created an enemy which flies
- Created script which spawns enemies on key pickup in level 1
There is little to no visual changes as I am not really a creative person and its going to take a long time for me to do it but I created several scripts and prefabs to make all of the modifications possible. Lots of gameplay additions.
